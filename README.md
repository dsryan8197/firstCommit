# firstCommit

Steps to contribute:

1. fork this repo (codebase) into your own Github account (you can use your personal one until you get your business acct). Daniels repo would be an example of the repo thats shared by the team and it contains the most up to date code. and your personal repo is exactly what it sounds like! its your personal repo where you can make changes and work on tasks without fear of messing up our master codebase.

2. clone your new repo to your computer so you can access the code in a folder on your desktop rather than in Github. (hint: git clone command)

3. Open your code in VSCode

4. You should only see a ReadMe file because this is the only file I included in this repo. Typically you would see lots of different files with code and stuff. ReadMe's are used for documentation, ie: the documentation you are reading right now to follow these steps. Typically ReadMes will have documentation instructing new developers on how to spin up the codebase.

5. Make a contribution to this ReadMe by answering the question below.

Question: Whats your favorite milkshake flavor? Cookies and cream

6. Learn how push your code to your personal Repo. You should push your code whenever you are finished with a feature or when you hit a milestone that you want to make sure you save. (hint: git push command)

7. Submit a PR (pull request) from your personal repo to the master repo (Daniel's repo). The team will then review the PR and decide to merge it into the master. In this case, I can merge your changes to my repo.
